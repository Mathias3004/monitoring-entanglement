# monitoring-entanglement
ITensor C++ code to sample stochastic trajectory states and study their monitoring induced entanglement. Different settings are investigated, emitters and driven-dissipative setup. Various network configurations are considered to study how they affect the generation (scaling) of entanglement in the trajectory states. Input scripts are used to adapt control (hyper) parameters. Run scripts contain the command line input to execute after compilation. The loop scripts repeatedly call the run script to submit a job for parameter set on the cluster.
